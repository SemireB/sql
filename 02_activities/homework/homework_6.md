**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on previous work I would adjust to include ethics and inequity components by:

1) Incorporating data minimization principles—only collecting and retaining data necessary for specific purposes. For instance there is a lot of data collected from customers in the farmer’s market database that doesn’t all seem necessary to the context they were collected for (ex. name, postal code, income, occupation). If there were to be a data breach some customers may be uncomfortable with the information being made public.


1) have more flexible data inputs for names/genders when it comes to the collection and management of customer data, to ensure that diverse customer perspectives are represented and to help identify and rectify potential biases in data collection and use.
