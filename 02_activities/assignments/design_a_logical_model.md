# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model
### Name: Semire Bamikole

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Type 1 is the architecture that would overwrite changes to the customer address table. Whenever a customer updates their address, the existing address is updated with the new address and the history of the previous address is deleted.

Type 2 is the architecture that would retain changes to the customer address table. Whenever a customer updates their address, a new record is inserted into the table with the new address and the history of the previous adress is kept with the effective date showing inactive for the old record and active for the new record.

With type 2 where changes are retained there are higher privacy implications due to the amount of personal data collected over time in the stored history.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Difference 1: the AdventureWorks Schema is very large so to help with readability and comprehension they categorized and colour coded the smaller schemas that interact to create the larger schema.

Difference 2: for each table in the AdventureWorks Schema the primary and foreign keys are identified for further comprehension.

Becasue my model is smaller and less complex I wouldn't categorize and colour code the schemas but I would add the primary and foreign keys for each of the tables.
